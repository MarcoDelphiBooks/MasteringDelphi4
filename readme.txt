Welcome to the 
Mastering Delphi 4 Source Code

This archive includes the the full source code (
including Pascal files, form description files, 
project files, and resource files) for all of the 
examples of the book. It includes also the HTML version
of the source code, with the proper syntax highlighting.

Because of their size, the compiled executable files are 
available in separate archives, one for each part of the 
book. Another archive (crossref4.zip) includes the files 
for the HTML cross reference. 

___________________
Directory Structure 

Once you've downloaded this archive and saved it on your 
hard disk, it will expand the files into a directory structure 
based on the book's parts and chapters. For example, all the 
files for Chapter 3's CreateC ("Create Component") example will 
be in the folder \Part1\03\CreateC. You can then load the files 
into Delphi, simply view the listings in any text editor, or browse
the HTML version of the source code.
